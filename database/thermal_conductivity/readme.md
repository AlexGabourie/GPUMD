# Some computed thermal conductivity results

* In each folder, there are three files:

| file            | description                                   |
|---------------- |-----------------------------------------------|
| create_xyz_in.m | create the xyz.in file for the simulation  |
| run.in          | the run.in file for the simulation   |
| kappa.txt       | the final results I obtained    |

*In kappa.txt
 * the frist column gives the temperature
 * the second column gives the average thermal conductivity
 * the thrid column gives the standard error

* number of independent simulations:
| folder            | number     |
|----------------   |------------|
| diamond           | 50  |
| germanium         | 50  |
